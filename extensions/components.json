For example, you may use a Trigger component, with *\"String\"* as *Type*, typing or pasting the url of interest in the *\"Value\"* field and then link it to the right input pin of the *PDF Reader*.\n\nOtherwise, if the file you need to extract the content from is directly available on your computer, then you can link for instance a File Reader block, with the *\"Read content\"* field untoggled, to the *\"file\"* pin input. \n\n",
